**Abstract**

Collusive fraud occurs when organizations or individuals work together to circumvent legal processes and procedures. Often these relation-ships are hidden behind layers of transactions that are difficult to detect. Recent developments in network science allow us to take a fresh look at collusive fraud. In this study, we apply OddBall to detect outliers in a procurement da-taset and also test whether node embeddings and role embeddings can be used as features by machine learning algorithms to identify collu-sion. We create a new network dataset from a large sample of World Bank procurement con-tracts between 2001 and 2021 for our experi-mentation. The network dataset has different World Bank entities, borrower countries and suppliers as nodes and awarded contracts as edges. The edges are weighted by contract amount. We also compared our results with the list of suppliers barred from doing business with the World Bank for engaging in various fraudulent activities in order to evaluate the success of our experiment.
