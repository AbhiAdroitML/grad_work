*** Abstract****

Voice of Customer can be captured to gain insights into what customers value, to improve product design,to understand 
competitive landscapes and to penetrate markets deeper. In this paper, we analyze a large sample of reviews on the 
Amazon site expressed by buyers of cellphones (US market). We explore 14 pre-determined topics related to common features 
of a cellphone and determine customer sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) across these features. We then compare the 
top 5 brands in the US cellphone market and provide a comparative analysis of their features.Instead of discovering the 
discussion topic in the text corpus,our approach assigns the discussion topic based on context relevant words, making it 
a more objective approach for comparing products with each other.
