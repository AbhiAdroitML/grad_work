Abstract

When modeling credit risk, a major concern is the class imbalance in the dataset used. In the case of a dataset with default or no-default assignment 
for companies, there is class imbalance when one class is considerably larger than the other. Generally, we observe fewer default class assignments 
because money lending occurs following proper due diligence and review of past performance. However, defaults do happen as external factors or the 
company's own performance deteriorates and hence the need for models to anticipate future default scenarios arises. In this study, we review six modeling 
techniques - Logistic Regression, Under-sampling (Near Miss), Under-sampling (Cluster Centroid), Grabit Model, Thresholding, and Extreme Machine Learning 
for handling class imbalanced data and compare their performance using the Polish companies’ bankruptcy data.
