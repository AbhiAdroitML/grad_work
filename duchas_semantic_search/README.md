Academic Project Statement:

Under guidance of Professor Barbara Hillers (bhillers@iu.edu), Indiana University - Bloomington, this project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic search algorithms in retrieving relevant information from the Schools' Collection available on www.Duchas.ie.

By applying advanced natural language processing techniques, we aim to provide users with a more efficient and accurate way of accessing historical and cultural content. At present, we provide the most relevant 50 results that match our semantic search.
For further information about this project, please contact Abhianv Bajpai at abbajpai@iu.edu.
