Climate change caused by rising global temperatures is one of our planet's most significant threats. The magnitude and pace of changes in global temperatures are significantly impacting various sectors, including agriculture, water resources, and human health. By analyzing multi-decadal temperature trends, scientists can identify the drivers of climate change, such as greenhouse gas emissions and changes in land use and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of global warming.

The multi-decadal temperature data have now been made public for analysis by various government agencies. However, temperature data is complex and heterogeneous because it differs both spatially and temporally. It is also collected from numerous sources, like weather stations, buoys, ships, and satellites. Thus, recording and measuring temperatures at different locations and time intervals generates a very large amount of data. Analyzing this large and complex data is a challenging task computationally and requires the support of big data technologies. 

In this project, we explore NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) daily data (Menne et al., 2012)  using various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, including BigQuery  (data warehouse and analysis), Dataproc  (distributed computing), and Looker Studio  (visualization) to provide insights into the global climate trends. 

Our primary objective is to showcase the effective implementation of big data management through a pipeline approach by utilizing the knowledge we have acquired from our coursework.
